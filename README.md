# Introduction

Made from Greg Fenton's SUPERHOEROES template.

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, Node.js) application made
of two processes:
   1. an Express "server" providing API support for retrieving and submitting
   data from the backend
   1. a React "client" providing a web-based UI


# Working with this Codebase
## Starting the Express server

In a command shell (CMD, PowerShell, Terminal, etc.) run the commands:
1. `cd server`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run start`

The server is now running on port *3000*.

## Starting the React client

In a command shell run the commands:
1. `cd client`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run start`

Your browser should open to `http://localhost:4444`.  The React development
system is running on port *4444*.

# Using your own MongoDB instance

You can run MongoDB locally on your machine or you can sign up for a no-cost(!)
account at `https://www.mongodb.com/`.

Once you have your MongoDB instance set up, simply edit the login information
that is found in `server/models/db.js` under the comment `// SETUP MONGO/MONGOOSE`.

For example, if you are using a local install you might set:

```js
const mongoUser = 'dbUser';
const mongoPasswd = 'hideMe!!';
const mongoDBName = 'my_mongo_db';
const mongoServer = 'localhost:27017';
```

You might add the initial data used in the public MongoDB instance:

```js
[
  {name: "Batwoman", nickname: null, alterego: "Kate Kane", sidekick: "Batgirl"},
  {name: "Bat-Girl", nickname: null, alterego: "Betty Kane", sidekick: null},
  {name: "Batman", nickname: "The Batman", alterego: "Bruce Wayne", sidekick: "Robin"},
  {name: "Robin", nickname: "The Boy Wonder", alterego: "Dick Grayson", sidekick: null},
]
```

# How this project was created

> **NOTE**: you only want to review this section if you are going to create
an entirely new project leveraging the same technologies and approach used for
this project

> **DOUBLE NOTE**: Tony manually modified this project since the creation, specifically removing the default index.js route, removing the jade view engine, and removing bin/www in lieu of a simpler use of server.js. If you follow the below steps you will end up with something that works but looks a bit different than what is checked in.

Here are the command-line steps taken to create the initial version of this project:
```bash
$ mkdir superheroes
$ cd superheroes
$ npx create-react-app --use-npm client
$ npx express-generator server
$ rm -rf client/.git client/.gitignore client/yarn.k
$ rm server/.gitignore
$ cat <<- EOF > .gitignore

   Changes to be committed:
     (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
          new file:   .gitignore
          new file:   README.md
          new file:   client/.env
          new file:   client/README.md
          new file:   client/package-lock.json
          new file:   client/package.json
          new file:   client/public/favicon.ico

          new file:   client/src/App.js
          new file:   client/src/App.test.js
          new file:   client/src/index.css
          new file:   client/src/index.js
          new file:   client/src/logo.svg
          new file:   client/src/reportWebVitals.js

          new file:   server/package.json
          new file:   server/public/stylesheets/style.css
          new file:   server/routes/index.js
          new file:   server/routes/users.js
$ git commit -m "initialize the project"
```

Now, we additionally enabled `nodemon` to reload the server code when it gets
edited.  To do that:
```bash
$ cd server
$ npm install --save-dev nodemon
$ perl -p -i -e 's/"start": "node /"start": "nodemon /' package.json
$ git add package.json 
$ git commit -m "adding nodemon to speed development"
$ cd ..
